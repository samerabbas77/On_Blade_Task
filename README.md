# Daily Task Management System

A simple Daily Task Management System built with Laravel Blade for frontend rendering and Cron Jobs for scheduled email notifications.

## Overview

This application allows users to manage their daily tasks with a straightforward user interface. Users can add, update, delete, and view tasks, and toggle their status between "Pending" and "Completed." Additionally, a daily Cron Job is implemented to send users an email listing their pending tasks for the day.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create, edit, delete, and update task status.
- **User Interface**: Built with Laravel Blade for dynamic, server-rendered pages.
- **Email Notifications**: A scheduled command sends an email every day containing pending tasks for each user.
- **Authentication**: Only registered users can access and manage their tasks.
- **Error Handling**: Error messages and handling to improve user experience.
- **Caching**: Tasks accessed frequently are cached to improve performance.

## Models

### Task

| Field       | Type    | Description                    |

## User Interface (Blade)

The user interface, built using Laravel Blade templates, includes pages for:
- Displaying a list of daily tasks
- Adding, editing, and deleting tasks
- Changing task status between "Pending" and "Completed"

### Blade Directives

Blade directives like `@if`, `@foreach`, and `@csrf` are used to ensure seamless and secure data handling.

## Scheduled Email Notification

The application includes a Cron Job to send a daily email of pending tasks. 

### Setting up the Command

1. Create the command using Artisan:
   ```bash
   php artisan make:command SendPendingTasks
   ```
   
2. Register the command in the `Kernel.php` file to run daily:
   ```php
   protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
   {
       $schedule->command('tasks:sendPending')->daily();
   }
   ```

3. Test the Cron Job locally by running:
   ```bash
   php artisan schedule:run
   ```

4. Deploy the Cron Job on the server by adding the following line to your server's crontab:
   ```bash
   * * * * * php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

## Authentication

Authentication is enforced so only registered users can access the system. Ensure users are registered and logged in to manage tasks.

## Caching

Frequently accessed tasks are cached to enhance the application's performance.

## Error Handling

Errors are handled gracefully, providing users with relevant feedback to enhance their experience.
